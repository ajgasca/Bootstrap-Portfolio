                            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website! I appreciate your time in visiting! Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Anthony Gasca. I'm a young adult and Phoenix native living in the Tempe area. If you would have asked me if I had any interest in building a website a year ago, I would have been dumfounded to give you an answer. In 2014, I graduated with a film degree from Arizona State University. My mind has always leaned to the more creative, so anything scientific or technical never crossed my radar. After spending some time trying to make a living in Los Angeles, I returned to Phoenix determined to create a new future. I've always loved learning and being challengeed. A family member suggested that I look into web development. After some serious reading on Google and watching various testimonies on Youtube, I am here today. I hope this website portrays my dedication to excellence and craftmanship. I am really proud of the skills I have learned and I hope to share them with you.</p>
                            <p>Another huge decision that prompted me to explore the world of web development is my current job. At this point in time, I work at an information technology firm that does staffing, training, and producing solutions. I work at the Front Desk and assist the Human Resources department. Since I interact with so many different people in the office each day, I am exposed to what our Professional Services team does. Their work and collaboration inspired me to discover what web development is all about. I figured that if I am going to expand in the technology field, I want to bring more skills to the proverbial table.</p>
                            <p>Outside of work and web development, I have a myriad of hobbies. I really enjoy living an active lifestyle so I lift weights daily, play volleyball occassionally, and go on hikes. As per my degree, I a huge film buff. I could tell you which movie to go see on any given Friday or what Netflix show to binge. Lastly, I enjoy writing, reading, and spending time with friends. Especially, when any of those activities are accompanied by a fantastic pour over or French press coffee.</p>
